# peng_data_analysis_diagram

This is a quick diagram I threw together as a cleaned-up version of the pen drawing accompanying [Roger Peng's excellent blog post about data analysis as a divergent-convergent design process.](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/09/14/divergent-and-convergent-phases-of-data-analysis/) 

The diagram was created using Inkscape, and the Inkscape .svg is provided.
